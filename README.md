## Manual Testing
This repository contains the General Test Cases for Manual Testing on the Webpage. It also has Test cases related to API Testing. Templates related to Test Plan, Sample TEST Cases, BUG Report and Test Case Format. 

## What is it all about ?
This project contains sample set of test cases for manual testers to help them save time for writing manual test cases. It also has the templates for the Test planning and different different types of samples test Cases.
 
## Why I Created this project ?
It is always a tedious and boring task to write test cases again n again, which takes most of the time of software testing. 
Hence, I decided to make generic test cases for the functionality majorly used in software testing so anyone can just download the copy and use it directly in their projects and save their time wasted in writing the generic test cases.

## Sample Test Cases and templates are added for the following:
- Generic field level test cases for Textbox, Dropdown-box/Multi-Dropdownbox, Checkbox, Radio button, Toggle button, Submit/Save/Cancel button and Date fields,
- Sample Test cases for Testing reports.
- Sample Test cases for Bug Report
- General Test Cases for Login/Logout functionality.
- Test Planning Checklist.

### Don't forget to give a STAR to make the project popular.
